<!-- ## About Me

Hi, I'm Michael Mosses Christianto — a college student majoring in Informatics, currently diving deep into the wonders of this field.

I'm fascinated by how computers work, how we can **talk** to them through code, and how they actually do what we ask. There's something magical about turning thoughts into logic and logic into reality.

I have a growing passion for game development (as a hobby — still learning, not sure where it's going, but it excites me), a bit of interest in backend web development, and of course... networks and cybersecurity always spark my curiosity.

But the best part?  
There’s *so much more* out there waiting to be explored — and I’m here for it, one keystroke at a time.
